### Proof
As the number of trials (N) increases, the Binomial distribution (for p = 0.5) approaches a Normal distribution. This is evident from the histograms which show the shape becoming more bell-like and symmetric.

### Hardware Survey Data Findings
The histograms and qualitative descriptions of the hardware survey data provide insights into the distributions and central tendencies of various features collected in the survey.
